I propose a B for my course grade.

Throughout the semester, I have worked diligently to complete every assignment and ensure my code met the required standards. 
While I started the semester with a few red-level issues, I took the reviews seriously and worked hard to address these problems. 
After the midterm, I successfully avoided repeating those red-level mistakes, which demonstrates clear improvement in my coding abilities.
My ability to troubleshoot and write clean, functional code has progressed significantly, and I believe this reflects my growing 
understanding of Data Structures.

The only significant area I struggled with was attendance. Toward the end of the semester, I encountered some challenges that impacted my 
ability to attend class consistently, but I don't believe I missed more than 10 meetings overall. Despite this, I remained engaged by 
reviewing the course materials independently, completing every assignment, and ensuring my code was up to the standards of the Programmer's 
Pact. While my attendance could have been stronger, my dedication to completing the work and engaging with the content on my own shows my 
commitment to learning.

At the midterm, I acknowledged areas for improvement, and I am proud that I made real progress after reflecting on my earlier mistakes.
I wish I could confidently propose an A, but I believe a B is a fair assessment of my performance in the course.
